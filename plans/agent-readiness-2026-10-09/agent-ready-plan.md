# Agent Readiness Plan — https://textwiz.pro

**Baseline:** 2/5 (Bot-Aware) — 12 pass, 4 fail, 6 neutral
**Scanner:** isitagentready.com · scanned 2026-10-09T10:19:46.320Z
**Verify with:** re-scan — `curl -sS -X POST https://isitagentready.com/api/scan -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"url":"https://textwiz.pro"}'`

Each task closes exactly one failing check. The scanner is the only source: descriptions are its own fix prompts, and every task is verified by re-scanning, not by inspection.

## Milestones

| ID | Phase | Exit condition | Verify with |
|---|---|---|---|
| M0 | P0 | re-scan reports level 3 (Agent-Readable) or higher | re-scan https://textwiz.pro |
| M1 | P1 | re-scan reports every discoverability and content-accessibility check as pass | re-scan https://textwiz.pro |
| M3 | P3 | re-scan reports every discovery check as pass | re-scan https://textwiz.pro |

**Critical path:** 0.1 → 1.1 → 1.2 → 3.1

## Deferred and out of scope

| Check | Severity | Why deferred | Revisit when |
|---|---|---|---|
| webBotAuth | low | Web Bot Auth directory not found (informational only) — reported as neutral, not a failing check | the scanner reports it as a failing check |
| x402 | low | x402 payment protocol not detected (not a commerce site) — the scanner detected no commerce signals on this site | the site starts selling to agents |
| mpp | low | MPP payment discovery not detected (not a commerce site) — the scanner detected no commerce signals on this site | the site starts selling to agents |
| ucp | low | UCP profile not found (not a commerce site) — the scanner detected no commerce signals on this site | the site starts selling to agents |
| acp | low | ACP discovery document not found (not a commerce site) — the scanner detected no commerce signals on this site | the site starts selling to agents |
| ap2 | low | AP2 not declared in A2A Agent Card (not a commerce site) — the scanner detected no commerce signals on this site | the site starts selling to agents |

**Already passing (12):** `robotsTxt`, `sitemap`, `robotsTxtAiRules`, `contentSignals`, `apiCatalog`, `oauthDiscovery`, `oauthProtectedResource`, `mcpServerCard`, `a2aAgentCard`, `agentSkills`, `webMcp`, `ard`
